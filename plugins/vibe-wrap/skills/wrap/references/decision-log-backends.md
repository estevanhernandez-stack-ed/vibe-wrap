# Decision-log backends

> **Audience:** vibe-wrap maintainers + builders configuring their decision log.
> **Status:** four backends locked for v0.1.0 — `file-md`, `file-jsonl`, `626labs-mcp`, `disabled`.

The decision log is a pluggable backend. vibe-wrap is a marketplace plugin shipped to any user, so the local file backends (`file-md` / `file-jsonl`) are the universal fallback — they need nothing but a writable path. An MCP backend is **optional**: if a decision-log MCP is available, log there. The recognized MCP we auto-detect is the 626Labs dashboard (`mcp__626labs-cloud__*`); when it's absent we fall back to the local file backend. The MCP is never required. This doc covers the contract every backend implements, the four shipped backends, the config precedence, the first-run UX, and the canonical decision shape.

> **Bring-your-own-MCP** — pointing the MCP backend at a different server's tool names is a noted follow-on, not shipped in this version. Today the MCP backend recognizes the 626Labs dashboard tools; the contract and fallback are written generically so a future config can add other servers without a breaking change.

## The canonical decision shape

Every backend reads and writes this shape. The render layer in vibe-wrap doesn't care which backend produced it.

```python
{
    "timestamp": "2026-05-10T15:42:00-05:00",   # ISO 8601 with TZ offset
    "title": "Locked breadcrumb storage at session-uuid.jsonl",
    "body": "Decided breadcrumb files partition by Claude Code session UUID...",
    "project_tag": "vibe-wrap",                  # optional; backend-specific use
    "link": "docs/session-wraps/2026-05-10-1542.md",  # optional
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `timestamp` | string (ISO 8601 + TZ) | yes | Match the shape sibling session-loggers use. |
| `title` | string | yes | One-line headline. Renders as a level-3 heading in `file-md`. |
| `body` | string | yes | Multi-paragraph allowed. Markdown OK. |
| `project_tag` | string | no | Backend-specific use. MCP backend maps this to the bound 626Labs project ID; file backends append it as a footer tag. |
| `link` | string | no | Path or URL to the originating wrap doc. File backends render as a footer link; MCP backend includes in the decision body. |

## The backend contract

Every backend implements three methods.

### `read(session_window) -> list[Decision]`

Return all decisions logged within the time window. `session_window` is a tuple of (start_ts, end_ts) — both ISO 8601 with TZ offset.

- **Empty window** → return `[]`.
- **Backend unreachable** → return `[]` and let `is_reachable()` flag the failure separately. Never raise.
- **Backend reads more than expected** (file has 10,000 entries, window covers 5) → filter in-process, return only matching entries.

### `append(decision) -> AppendResult`

Append one decision. Returns a small dict with backend-specific reference info.

```python
{
    "ok": True | False,
    "backend": "file-md" | "file-jsonl" | "626labs-mcp" | "disabled",
    "ref": "/path/to/decisions.md:line-45" | "<mcp-decision-id>" | None,
    "error": None | "<short error string>",
}
```

- **Append failure** → return `{"ok": False, "error": "..."}` rather than raising. The wrap flow surfaces the failure in chat without aborting.
- **Disabled backend** → returns `{"ok": True, "backend": "disabled", "ref": None}` — append is a no-op.

### `is_reachable() -> bool`

Quick (<500ms) liveness check. Used by the wrap flow to decide whether to surface a fallback note.

| Backend | `is_reachable` semantics |
|---|---|
| `file-md` | File at the resolved path is readable + writable (or the parent dir is writable for first append). |
| `file-jsonl` | Same as `file-md`. |
| `626labs-mcp` | Cheap MCP call — pings the auto-detected decision-log MCP (the recognized one is the 626Labs dashboard, `mcp__626labs-cloud__manage_decisions`) with a no-op or trivial query. Times out at 500ms. Returns `False` when no MCP is reachable, which routes the dispatcher to the local file fallback. |
| `disabled` | Always returns `True` (nothing to fail). |

## The four backends

### `file-md` — Markdown file

**The universal fallback — the default whenever no decision-log MCP is reachable.**

Reads and writes a Markdown file. Smart default path resolves at first run:

- If the bound repo has a `docs/` directory → `<repo>/docs/decisions.md`.
- Else → `~/.claude/decisions.md` (user-scoped, lands next to cloud-syncable personal files — Dropbox, iCloud, OneDrive territory).

**Append strategy** (locked answer to spec Open Issue #8):

1. If today's date heading (`## YYYY-MM-DD`) exists in the file → append a new `### HH:mm — <title>` section under it.
2. Else → append a fresh `## YYYY-MM-DD` heading at end-of-file followed by the new `### HH:mm — <title>` section.
3. If the user's existing file uses no heading structure (flat append-style) → append in flat style at end-of-file with a separator.

**Read strategy:**

1. Parse any level-3 heading under any level-2 date heading (the canonical shape).
2. Tolerate flat-no-heading files (treat each `### ...` block at any depth as a decision).
3. Tolerate reverse-chrono ordering — sort by parsed `timestamp` after read.
4. Skip any heading that doesn't have a parseable date/time prefix; surface a one-line warning at wrap time so the user knows the file has structural drift.

**Render shape per decision:**

```markdown
### 15:42 — Locked breadcrumb storage at session-uuid.jsonl

Decided breadcrumb files partition by Claude Code session UUID...

— [Wrap doc](docs/session-wraps/2026-05-10-1542.md) · `vibe-wrap`
```

### `file-jsonl` — JSONL file

Same path resolution as `file-md`. Each decision is one JSON object per line, exactly the canonical decision shape with no extra wrapping. Append uses the shared `atomic-append-jsonl.py` script (tmp-file + fsync + rename, atomic per-line). Read = parse line-by-line, filter by `timestamp` window.

JSONL is the right choice when the user wants a machine-readable log they can pipe through `jq` or feed into other tooling. Markdown is the right choice when the user wants a log they read directly.

### `626labs-mcp` — decision-log MCP (auto-detects the 626Labs dashboard)

An **optional** MCP backend. It auto-detects a decision-log MCP and routes reads/writes through it; the recognized MCP today is the 626Labs dashboard, whose tools are surfaced as `mcp__626labs-cloud__*`. When no MCP is reachable, the dispatcher uses the local file fallback instead — this backend is never a hard dependency.

| Method | MCP call |
|---|---|
| `read(window)` | `mcp__626labs-cloud__manage_decisions` with `action: "search"` + `since: window.start` + `until: window.end`. Maps the response into the canonical decision shape. |
| `append(decision)` | `mcp__626labs-cloud__manage_decisions` with `action: "log"` + `title` + `body` + `projectId: <bound>` + `link` in body. Returns the MCP-issued decision ID as `ref`. |
| `is_reachable()` | Cheap MCP probe — read a known-empty query with a 500ms timeout. False when no decision-log MCP answers. |

The MCP backend respects the project-binding convention from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. If the current repo is bound to a 626Labs project, the decision tags with that project's ID. If unbound, `projectId: null` and the description includes the repo name as a fallback tag (matching the existing decision-logging discipline).

**The dashboard bridge stays MCP-only.** `bridge_context_to_architect` (`mcp__626labs-cloud__bridge_context_to_architect`) is a dashboard-specific composition — the strategic-layer counterpart to the operating-layer decision log. Other backends may add their own bridge contracts in future versions (e.g., a Linear backend could bridge to a Linear project; a Notion backend could bridge to a Notion database). For v0.1.0, the bridge gate appears only when the active backend is `626labs-mcp` and the threshold (see `spec.md > Decision 3`) fires. Bring-your-own-MCP — a user pointing this backend at their own server's tool names — is the noted follow-on; the contract here is generic so it can land without a breaking change.

### `disabled` — no-op

Read returns `[]`. Append is a no-op (returns `{"ok": True, "backend": "disabled", "ref": None}`). `is_reachable` returns `True` because there's nothing to fail.

The wrap flow detects `disabled` backend and skips the decision-log read section ("decision logging is disabled"), the decision-log append gate (no prompt at all), and the dashboard bridge gate (since bridge requires `626labs-mcp`). Clean opt-out for users who don't want a decision log surface.

## Config precedence

Active backend is resolved in this order:

1. **Per-project config** — `<repo>/.vibe-wrap/config.json`. Highest priority.
2. **Global config** — `~/.claude/plugins/data/vibe-wrap/config.json`.
3. **Auto-detect** — if a decision-log MCP is reachable (the recognized one is the 626Labs dashboard, `mcp__626labs-cloud__manage_decisions`) → `626labs-mcp`. No prompt. Optional — when nothing answers, fall through.
4. **First-run prompt** — when none of the above resolve.

### Config schema

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "decision_log": {
    "backend": "file-md",
    "file_path": "~/.claude/decisions.md",
    "auto_detect_mcp": true
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `schema_version` | integer | yes | Always `1` for v0.1.0. |
| `decision_log.backend` | string | yes | One of `"file-md"`, `"file-jsonl"`, `"626labs-mcp"`, `"disabled"`. |
| `decision_log.file_path` | string | conditional | Required for `file-md` and `file-jsonl`. Ignored otherwise. Tilde expansion supported. |
| `decision_log.auto_detect_mcp` | boolean | no | Default `true`. When `false`, never auto-promote to `626labs-mcp` even if reachable. |

### Edge cases

- **Both global and per-project config exist** → per-project wins. Document this clearly in any wrap-time warning if the global is more permissive.
- **Per-project file_path doesn't resolve** (file deleted, dir gone) → fall back to global. If global also fails → trigger first-run prompt with a one-line note explaining the fallback.
- **Per-project config has invalid JSON** → log a warning, fall back to global.

## First-run UX

When config doesn't resolve and MCP isn't reachable, vibe-wrap shows the four-option picker exactly once. After the user picks, the choice persists to the chosen scope (global by default; per-project if the user picks a per-project file path).

### Picker copy (locked v0.1.0)

```
vibe-wrap doesn't see a decision log yet. pick one — you can change it
later by re-running with --reconfigure or editing the config file.

  1. Markdown file at <smart-default>/decisions.md   ← recommended
     human-readable, lives in your repo (or ~/.claude/), easy to share

  2. JSONL file at <smart-default>/decisions.jsonl
     machine-readable, pipeable through jq, append-only

  3. 626Labs Dashboard (MCP)
     unavailable in this environment — install MCP first

  4. disabled
     skip decision logging entirely; wrap doc just won't include this section

choose [1-4]:
```

When a decision-log MCP is reachable, option 3 reads `available — pings to mcp__626labs-cloud__manage_decisions succeed` and is shown enabled. Auto-detect already picks it in that case, so the picker only fires when the user has explicitly disabled auto-detect or the MCP just dropped.

### Persistence confirmation

After the user picks:

```
saved <backend-name> as your default decision log.
config: <path-to-config.json>

run /vibe-wrap --reconfigure anytime to change.
```

Two-line confirmation. No emoji. Clear next move.

## Why pluggable

- vibe-wrap is a marketplace plugin shipped to any user. Treating 626Labs MCP as the only decision-log surface silently breaks the value prop for every non-626Labs user — which is the whole marketplace audience.
- A useful default (Markdown file at the smart-default path) inspires users to keep a decision log even if they didn't have one before. The wrap section names what's there; the user starts to see the value of having something there.
- The contract is small enough that future backends (Linear, Notion, a user's own scripted log) can be added in `/evolve-wrap` cycles without breaking v0.1.0 backends.

- **Subsystem layout** — `spec.md > Decision-log subsystem` lists the seven Python modules under `skills/wrap/scripts/decision-log/`.
- **Bridge gate threshold** — `spec.md > Decision 3` and `gate-design.md` cover when the dashboard bridge gate appears (MCP backend + threshold met).
